## Aim/Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a gesture recognition system for smart TVs using deep learning architectures.

## Background
In the era of smart technology, enhancing user experience is crucial. Gesture recognition offers an intuitive way for users to interact with their devices, eliminating the need for traditional remotes.

## About the Data
The dataset comprises video recordings of hand gestures, including thumbs up, thumbs down, left swipe, right swipe, and stop gestures. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command for controlling the TV.

## Used Technology
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (Conv3D)

## Acknowledgment
I acknowledge the contribution of Professor Raghavan and Snehansu, a research engineer at American Express, for introducing the problem statement and providing valuable guidance throughout the project. I also extend my gratitude to Upgrade Academy for their support and resources.
